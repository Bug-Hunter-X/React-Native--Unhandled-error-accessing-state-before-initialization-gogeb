# React Native: Unhandled error accessing state before initialization

This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native: attempting to access a state variable before it's initialized.  The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code.  The solution, found in `bugSolution.js`, utilizes conditional rendering and/or asynchronous operations to handle the situation gracefully.

## Problem

Accessing state variables within the `render` method before they're populated by asynchronous operations (such as network requests) can result in errors like `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading '...')`.

## Solution

The solution involves checking for the existence of the state variable before attempting to access its properties.  This can be done using optional chaining (?.) or conditional rendering.  Additionally, ensuring state initialization in the constructor or using a loading state can improve the user experience.

## How to run

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the repository in your terminal.
3. Run `npm install` or `yarn install`.
4. Run the app using your preferred React Native method (e.g., `npx react-native run-android` or `npx react-native run-ios`).
